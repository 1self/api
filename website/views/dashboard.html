                                        </p>
                                        <p>Try squinting at the picture - what does the overall pattern tell you? Try scanning horizontally along the days to see the daily pattern of when you push. Which days do you push most? Do you push on the weekend? Try scanning vertically, is there a pattern? Do you push before lunch? Before you finish working for the day? Are there parts of the week that don’t have any pushes at all? Why is that?

We take all the activity over each day for the last month, add it up, then show it to you. The data goes back over a month.

Make sure you check back on the dashboard to see the patterns emerge as you build your data up towards a full month.

To see something interesting you need to wait until you see lots of days where you were active in your IDE and also pushing up to GitHub. It will take a few weeks before you see this. We recommend leaving the data collection going and then coming back after 2 weeks. Why not set

The hourly builds shows the pattern of when you were building over each day of the week. Have a squint, what’s the overall picture? What specific patterns do you see? Do you break for lunch at the same time every day? Do you program on the weekends? Are you a morning person or a night owl?

Make sure you check back on the dashboard to see the patterns emerge as you build your data up towards a full month.
