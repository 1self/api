    Hey, <br/><br/>

    I’ve just been checking out my dev data on 1self and I’d like to share it with you. Once you accept my
    request to share you’ll be able to see my data and I’ll be able to see yours. We’ll be able to compare our GitHub
    pushes, build history, IDE activity and more. Let’s find out if we’re peas-in-a-pod or chalk-and-cheese! Please hit
    share and compare :)

    <br/><br/>

    <a href="{{ acceptUrl }}">Share and Compare</a> | <a href="{{ rejectUrl }}">Not this time!</a> <br/><br/>

    Thanks! <br/>
